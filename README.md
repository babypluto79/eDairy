# Dairy-Cooperative-Management-App
Firebase and Material Design at Its's best hahaa..... This big project was developed in a span of 3 weeks. Utilizing Firebase authentication,
database and file upload, this app is used by dairy cooperative societies to register farmers by entering their details including name,
phone number, email and village. this registration also creates a user account for the farmer. The cooperative society also can register milk 
collectors and assign them villages to collect milk from. when the collector logs on to the app, he/she accesses a list of farmers from 
the village he/she was assigned to. he/she then record the milk  given by these farmers. when the farmer logs on, he/she can access all the 
milk record given to the cooperative society and also all payment records from the cooperative society. The admin who is the dairy cooperative
manager also sets the milk price and the system then calculates the money in your account by adding the total amount of milk in the farmers 
account and multiplying by the milk price and substracting all the withdrawals or the payments from the cooperative society...
in the material design part, I have FloatingActionButton, ViewPagers for fragments and awesome ToolBars ofcourse from V7 ....Firebase though 
does not support background data as from android 4.4
